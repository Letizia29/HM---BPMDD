	abstract = {Although the concept of left-hemispheric lateralization of neural processes during speech production has been known since the times of Broca, its physiological underpinnings still remain elusive. We sought to assess the modulatory influences of a major neurotransmitter, dopamine, on hemispheric lateralization during real-life speaking using a multimodal analysis of functional MRI, intracranial EEG recordings, and large-scale neural population simulations based on diffusion-weighted MRI. We demonstrate that speech-induced phasic dopamine release into the dorsal striatum and speech motor cortex exerts direct modulation of neuronal activity in these regions and drives left-hemispheric lateralization of speech production network. Dopamineinduced lateralization of functional activity and networks during speaking is not dependent on lateralization of structural nigro-striatal and nigro-motocortical pathways. Our findings provide the first mechanistic explanation for left-hemispheric lateralization of human speech that is due to leftlateralized dopaminergic modulation of brain activity and functional networks.},

DAT imaging can therefore assist the differentiation between  conditions with and without presynaptic dopaminergic deficit.

Methods: A total of 423 untreated PD, 196 Healthy Control (HC) and 64 SWEDD (scans without evidence of dopaminergic deﬁcit) subjects were enrolled at 24 sites. To enroll PD subjects as early as possible following diagnosis, subjects were eligible with only asymmetric bradykinesia or tremor plus a dopamine transporter (DAT) binding deﬁcit on SPECT imaging. Acquisition of data was standardized as detailed at www.ppmi-info.org. Results: Approximately 9\% of enrolled subjects had a single PD sign at baseline. DAT imaging excluded 16\% of potential PD subjects with SWEDD. The total MDS-UPDRS for PD was 32.4 compared to 4.6 for HC and 28.2 for SWEDD. On average, PD subjects demonstrated 45\% and 68\% reduction in mean striatal and contralateral putamen Speciﬁc Binding Ratios (SBR), respectively. Cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF) was acquired from {\textgreater}97\% of all subjects. CSF (PD/HC/SWEDD pg/mL) a-synuclein (1845/2204/2141) was reduced in PD vs HC or SWEDD (P {\textless} 0.03). Similarly, t-tau (45/53) and p-tau (16/18) were reduced in PD versus HC (P {\textless} 0.01), Interpretation: PPMI has detailed the biomarker signature for an early PD cohort deﬁned by clinical features and imaging biomarkers. This strategy provides the framework to establish biomarker cohorts and to deﬁne longitudinal progression biomarkers to support future PD treatment trials.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Parkinson's disease (PD) characteristically presents with asymmetrical symptoms, contralateral to the side of the most extensive cerebral affection. This intriguing asymmetry, even included in the definition for diagnosing PD, however, is still part of a mystery. The relation with handedness as a common indicator of cerebral asymmetry might provide a clue in the search for causal factors of asymmetrical symptom onset in PD. This possible relationship, however, is still under debate. The objective of this study was to establish whether a relation between handedness and dominant PD side exists. We searched for cross‐sectional or cohort studies that registered handedness and onset side in PD patients in PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science from their first record until 14 February 2011. Data about handedness and dominant PD side was extracted. Authors who registered both but not described their relation were contacted for further information. Odds ratios (ORs) were analyzed with a fixed effect Mantel‐Haenszel model. Heterogeneity and indications of publication bias were limited. Our electronic search identified 10 studies involving 4405 asymmetric PD patients. Of the right‐handed patients, 2413 (59.5\%) had right‐dominant and 1644 (40.5\%) had left‐dominant PD symptoms. For the left‐handed patients this relation was reversed, with 142 (40.8\%) right‐dominant and 206 (59.2\%) left‐dominant PD symptoms. Overall OR was 2.13 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.71–2.66). Handedness and symptom dominance in PD are firmly related with each other in such a way that the PD symptoms emerge more often on the dominant hand‐side. Possible causal factors are discussed. © 2011 Movement Disorder Society},

	abstract = {Parkinson’s disease (PD) is characterized by the progressive and asymmetrical degeneration of the nigrostriatal dopamine neurons and the unilateral presentation of the motor symptoms at onset, contralateral to the most impaired hemisphere. We previously developed a rat PD model that mimics these typical features, based on unilateral injection of a substrate inhibitor of excitatory amino acid transporters, L-trans-pyrrolidine-2,4-dicar­ boxylate (PDC), in the substantia nigra (SN). Here, we used this progressive model in a multilevel study (behavioral testing, in vivo 1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy, slice electrophysiology, immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization) to characterize the functional changes occurring in the cortico-basal ganglia-cortical network in an evolving asymmetrical neurodegeneration context and their possible contribution to the cell death progression. We focused on the corticostriatal input and the subthalamic nucleus (STN), two glutamate com­ ponents with major implications in PD pathophysiology. In the striatum, glutamate and glutamine levels increased from presymptomatic stages in the PDC-injected hemisphere only, which also showed enhanced glu­ tamatergic transmission and loss of plasticity at corticostriatal synapses assessed at symptomatic stage. Sur­ prisingly, the contralateral STN showed earlier and stronger reactivity than the ipsilateral side (increased intraneuronal cytochrome oxidase subunit I mRNA levels; enhanced glutamate and glutamine concentrations). Moreover, its lesion at early presymptomatic stage halted the ongoing neurodegeneration in the PDC-injected SN and prevented the expression of motor asymmetry. These findings reveal the existence of endogenous inter­ hemispheric processes linking the primary injured SN and the contralateral STN that could sustain progressive dopamine neuron loss, opening new perspectives for disease-modifying treatment of PD.},

This study investigated the prevalence of patients with “wrong-sided” lesions, that is, patients with symptoms on the side ipsilateral to the predominant dopaminergic nigrostriatal deﬁcit. Methods: The analyzed sample included 434 early unmedicated PD patients from the Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative database. Asymmetry indices of motor function and putamen [123I]FP-CIT SPECT were calculated from the screening visit data. Results: Ipsilateral deﬁcits were unexpectedly common even when only patients with clear motor and dopaminergic asymmetries were included in the analysis (8.1\%, n = 24/295). When patients with any asymmetry were included in the analysis, the prevalence of ipsilateral deﬁcits was 15.4\% (n = 65/423). Wrong-sided symptoms were not associated with the PD motor subtype. However, the dataset was heavily biased toward tremordominant patients (85\% of patients). Right-handed PD patients had predominantly right-sided motor symptoms and left-sided dopamine defects, whereas the effect was opposite in left-handed patients (P = 0.005 and 0.028, respectively). Interpretation: The results indicate that the side of the predominant motor symptoms and the corresponding side of the dopaminergic defects in PD are not random, but are directed by brain lateralization. Importantly, the traditional pathogenetic model of nigral degeneration causing primarily contralateral motor symptoms may be inadequate in many patients.},

Even 200 years after the first description of the disease, the underlying causes for this striking clinicopathological feature are not yet fully understood. There is increasing evidence that lateralisation of disease is due to a complex interplay of hereditary and environmental factors that are reflected not only in the concept of dominant hemispheres and handedness but also in specific susceptibilities of neuronal subpopulations within the substantia nigra. As a consequence, not only the obvious lateralisation of motor symptoms occurs but also patterns of associated non-motor signs are defined, which include cognitive functions, sleep behaviour or olfaction. Better understanding of the mechanisms contributing to lateralisation of neurodegeneration and the resulting patterns of clinical phenotypes based on bilateral post-mortem brain analyses and clinical studies focusing on right/left hemispheric symptom origin will help to develop more targeted therapeutic approaches, taking into account subtypes of PD as a heterogeneous disorder.},

The average and laterality of SBRs in MSA-P were similar to those in PD and PSP. The asymmetry indices were similar among PD, PSP, and MSA-P. These data suggest that PSP shows a pattern of SBRs different from that in PD, attributed to HY stage I in PD.

              Background
              Asymmetric hemispheric loss of dopaminergic neurons is one of the characteristic features of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, it is still debated if right or left asymmetry differently affects cognitive and motor progression.
            
            
              Objectives
              The objective of this study was to investigate, for the first time, the relevance of dopamine transporter (DAT) asymmetry on cognitive and motor manifestations at onset and at 4‐year progression in drug‐naïve PD.
            
            
              Methods
              From the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative multicenter cohort, we identified 249 right‐handed patients with PD with baseline asymmetry greater than 20\% in putamen DAT binding at single‐photon emission computed tomography. A predominant putamen asymmetry was found on the left in 143 patients (PD‐left), and on the right side in 106 patients (PD‐right); we compared them with 196 healthy controls. Patients were followed longitudinally (2‐year and 4‐year visits), examining their clinical, cognitive, and imaging data.
            
            
              Results
              At baseline, the PD‐left group showed worse performance on the Symbol Digit Modality Test, an attention and processing‐speed test, and lower cerebrospinal fluid β‐amyloid levels than the PD‐right group. These differences were maintained at follow‐up, declining over time in both groups. By contrast, the PD‐right group showed greater motor impairment at baseline, which increased over 4 years. Striatal DAT binding decreased over time in both groups, but the PD‐right group showed a steeper decline, particularly during the first 2‐year follow‐up. Putaminal asymmetry assessed at baseline was maintained over time.
            
            
              Conclusions
              
                These findings suggest that hemispheric asymmetric dopaminergic denervation influences PD cognitive and motor performance as well as progression. Predominant right hemisphere nigrostriatal dopaminergic loss is associated with greater motor severity, whereas more pronounced left hemisphere denervation affects cognitive manifestations at onset and their progression. © 2021 The Authors.

	abstract = {Objective: Whether perivascular space (PVS) visible on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) represents glymphatic dysfunction and whether this imaging marker is pathologic in Parkinson’s disease (PD) have been controversial. The objective was to determine whether PVS visible on MRI is independently associated with cognitive decline in patients with PD, and to test whether pathologic proteins in the CSF (such as Aβ42) mediate the pathologic role of PVS.
Methods: A total of 341 patients with Parkinson’s disease from Parkinson’s Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) cohort was included in the present study. PVS in the basal ganglia (BG-PVS) and centrum semiovale were evaluated with a semiquantitative scale. Changes in the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score and the absolute MoCA score at the 3-year assessment were considered the main cognitive outcome. A multivariable linear regression model was used to test the association between PVS and cognitive decline. A mixed linear model and path analysis were used to test the interaction among PVS, CSF biomarkers and cognitive decline.
Results: BG-PVS was associated with cognitive decline in patients with PD at the 3-year follow-up independent of age, baseline cognition, motor and nonmotor function, presynaptic dopaminergic deficiency, and CSF bio­ markers. The interaction between BG-PVS and Aβ42/tTau, Aβ42/pTau, and Aβ42 levels was significantly pre­ dictive of 3-year cognitive decline. Path analysis confirmed that CSF Aβ42/tTau levels partially mediated the pathologic effect of BG-PVS on cognitive outcome in PD.
Conclusions: BG-PVS is independently associated with cognitive decline in PD, and this association may be partially mediated by toxic CSF proteins.},

	abstract = {Introduction: The relationship of prodromal markers of PD with PD mortality is unclear. Electronic health records (EHRs) provide a large source of raw data that could be useful in the identification of novel relevant prognostic factors in PD. We aimed to provide a proof of concept for automated data mining and pattern recognition of EHRs of PD patients and to study associations between prodromal markers and PD mortality.
Methods: Data from EHRs of PD patients (n = 2522) were collected from the Turku University Hospital database between 2006 and 2016. The data contained {\textgreater}27 million words/numbers and {\textgreater}750000 unique expressions. The 5000 most common words were identified in three-year time period before PD diagnosis. Cox regression was used to investigate the association of expressions with the 5-year survival of PD patients.
Results: During the five-year period after PD diagnosis, 839 patients died (33.3\%). If expressions associated with psychosis/hallucinations were identified within 3 years before the diagnosis, worse survival was observed (hazard ratio = 1.71, 95\%CI = 1.46–1.99, p {\textless} 0.001). Similar effects were observed for words associated with cognition (1.23, 1.05–1.43, p = 0.009), constipation (1.34, 1.15–1.56, p = 0.0002) and pain (1.34, 1.12–1.60, p = 0.001).
Conclusions: Automated mining of EHRs can predict relevant clinical outcomes in PD. The approach can identify factors that have previously been associated with survival and detect novel associations, as observed in the link between poor survival and prediagnostic pain. The significance of early pain in PD prognosis should be the focus of future studies with alternate methods.},

	abstract = {Parkinson disease (PD) is a neurological movement disorder resulting primarily from damage to and degeneration of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway. The pathway consists of neural populations in the substantia nigra that project to the striatum of the brain where they release dopamine. Diagnosis of PD is based on the presence of impaired motor features such as asymmetric or unilateral resting tremor, bradykinesia, and rigidity. Nonmotor features including cognitive impairment, sleep disorders, and autonomic dysfunction are also present. No cure for PD has been discovered, and treatment strategies focus on symptomatic management through restoration of dopaminergic activity. However, proposed cell replacement therapies are promising because midbrain dopaminergic neurons have been shown to restore dopaminergic neurotransmission and functionally rescue the dopamine-depleted striatum. In this review, we summarize our current understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of neurodegeneration in PD and discuss the development of new therapeutic strategies that have led to the initiation of exploratory clinical trials. We focus on the applications of stem cells for the treatment of PD and discuss how stem cell research has contributed to an understanding of PD, predicted the eﬃcacy of novel neuroprotective therapeutics, and highlighted what we believe to be the critical areas for future research.},

	abstract = {Objective: In right-handed patients with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (IRBD) or Par­ kinson’s disease (PD), dopamine transporter (DAT) single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) shows a predominant nigrostriatal deficit in the left striatum. To confirm this hypothesis, we longitudinally investigated whether the nigrostriatal function is asymmetric in Japanese patients with IRBD.
Methods: In 91 polysomnography-confirmed IRBD patients, which included 87 right-handed IRBD patients who underwent 33 repeat DAT-SPECT scans, we retrospectively examined the striatal dopaminergic terminals in each hemisphere using DAT-SPECT. We calculated the values of interhemispheric laterality index for the right and left sides.
Results: The proportion of IRBD patients with lower SBR in the striatum was different between the left (n = 60, 69.0\%) and right (n = 27, 31.0\%) hemispheres. In the repeat DAT-SPECT scan (n = 33), the rate of decline in the striatum was greater on the left than on the right side, and the proportion of patients with lower decline rates in the left striatum (n = 25, 73.5\%) was greater than the that in the right striatum (n = 3, 8.8\%). The proportion of lower SBR side at baseline did not predict the development of PD or DLB.
Conclusion: Right-handed IRBD patients have asymmetric nigrostriatal dopaminergic function, as evidenced by the faster estimated rate of decline for the left striatum than the right striatum. The left-right hemispheric striatal predominance of the nigrostriatal deficit in the right-handed prodromal PD or DLB patients represents a dif­ ference in the early pathological process of the disease.},

	abstract = {In specialized movement disorder centers, Parkinson’s disease (PD) is wrongly diagnosed in 6 to 25\% of cases. To improve the accuracy of the clinical diagnosis, it is necessary to have a reliable and practical reference standard. Dopamine transporter single-photon emission computed tomography (DAT SPECT) imaging might have the potential (high diagnostic accuracy and practical to use) to act as reference standard in detecting nigrostriatal cell loss in patients with (early stage) parkinsonism. We performed a systematic review to evaluate if DAT SPECT imaging can be used as such. Relevant studies were searched in the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases. Studies were selected when they met the following criteria: (1) all patients were adults with a clinical diagnosis of PD or clinically uncertain parkinsonism and (2) the study reported original data. In addition, studies needed to fulfill one of the two following criteria: (1) patients underwent at least one DAT SPECT and had a neuropathological confirmed diagnosis and (2) patients underwent at least two DAT SPECT scans, performed at least 2 years apart. The search identified 1,649 articles. Eight studies fulfilled our selection criteria and were included in this review. There was only one study including patients with diagnostic uncertainty. Sensitivity and specificity of DAT SPECT imaging to detect nigrostriatal cell loss were 98\%. The other studies included patients with a diagnosis of PD in whom there was no uncertainty. In these studies, sensitivity was 100\%. Our systematic review indicates that DAT SPECT imaging seems to be accurate to detect nigrostriatal cell loss in patients with parkinsonism.},

	abstract = {Objective Unilateral onset of parkinsonism due to nigrostriatal damage of the contralateral hemisphere is frequent in Parkinson disease (PD). There is evidence for a left-hemispheric bias of motor asymmetry in right-handed patients with PD indicating a hemispheric dominance. Isolated REM sleep behavior disorder (IRBD) constitutes the prodromal stage of PD and other synucleinopathies. To test the hypothesis that right-handed patients with IRBD exhibit lefthemispheric predominance of subclinical nigrostriatal dysfunction, we evaluated this aspect using neuroimaging instruments.
Methods In 167 right-handed patients with IRBD without parkinsonism, we evaluated in each hemisphere the integrity of the striatal dopaminergic terminals by dopamine transporter (DAT)SPECT and the substantia nigra echogenicity by transcranial sonography.
Results DAT-SPECT showed lower speciﬁc binding ratio (SBR) in the left striatum and left caudate nucleus than in the right striatum and right caudate nucleus. The percentage of patients with lower SBR was greater in the left striatum and left caudate nucleus than in the right striatum and right caudate nucleus. In those who developed a synucleinopathy in {\textless}5 years from DATSPECT, there was a lower SBR in the left putamen and left caudate nucleus than in the right putamen and right caudate nucleus. Substantia nigra echogenic size was greater in the left than in the right side in patients with hyperechogenicity and among individuals who phenoconverted in {\textless}5 years from transcranial sonography.
Conclusion Right-handed patients with IRBD exhibit left-hemispheric predominance of subclinical nigrostriatal dysfunction. In premotor PD, the neurodegenerative process begins asymmetrically, initially impairing the nigrostriatal system of the dominant hemisphere.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Patients with multiple system atrophy (MSA) are conventionally identified as having MSA-P (prominent parkinsonism) or MSA-C (prominent cerebellar ataxia) based on their predominant motor manifes­ tations. The objective of the present study was to conduct latent class analysis (LCA) of various motor and nonmotor symptoms in early MSA to characterize data-driven subgroups.
Methods: Sixty-one probable or possible MSA patients with disease durations of 3 years or less were included prospectively. LCAs were performed to identify similar clinical subgroups giving even weights to a wide range of MSA motor and nonmotor features. We ran latent models of up to 6 class solutions; the overall model fit was evaluated based on the parsimony of the derived classes, the fit indices, and clinical interpretability.
Results: The LCA outcome supported categorization of at least three subgroups of patients with early MSA: the largest class 1, labeled “moderate parkinsonism + extensive dysautonomia”, included approximately half of our study patients and showed marked autonomic dysfunction with a burden of parkinsonism. The two other classes, class 2 “predominant parkinsonism + limited dysautonomia” and class 3 “predominant cerebellar symptoms + limited dysautonomia”, showed marked core motor features (parkinsonism or cerebellar symptoms) with generally mild dysautonomia.
Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first data-driven identification of disease subtypes covering various symptom constellations in early MSA ({\textless}3 years from motor symptom onset). The present LCA result did not replicate the conventional motor classification and supported the heterogeneity within MSA-P and MSA-C subtypes.},

	abstract = {Parkinson's Disease is the second most common progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting older American adults and is predicted to increase in  prevalence as the United States population ages. Resulting from a  pathophysiologic loss or degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia  nigra of the midbrain and the development of neuronal Lewy Bodies, idiopathic  Parkinson's Disease is associated with risk factors including aging, family  history, pesticide exposure and environmental chemicals (e.g., synthetic heroin  use). Its ultimate cause(s) is (are) unknown. Characterized by both motor and  non-motor symptoms, PD patients classically display rest tremor, rigidity,  bradykinesia, and stooping posture. PD can also be associated with  neurobehavioral disorders (depression, anxiety), cognitive impairment (dementia),  and autonomic dysfunction (e.g., orthostasis and hyperhidrosis). Recent decades  have witnessed a proliferation of medical pharmacologic therapies and innovative  surgical interventions like deep brain stimulation (DBS). However, definitive  disease-modifying therapy is still lacking. Experimental therapies are being  developed and tested with limited results. Knowledge of strategies to promote  optimal quality of life for PD patients is of paramount importance for  caregivers, health providers and patients themselves.},
