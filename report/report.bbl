    Parkinson's Disease is the second most common progressive neurodegenerative
  disorder affecting older American adults and is predicted to increase in
  prevalence as the United States population ages. Resulting from a
  pathophysiologic loss or degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the
  substantia nigra of the midbrain and the development of neuronal Lewy Bodies,
  idiopathic Parkinson's Disease is associated with risk factors including
  aging, family history, pesticide exposure and environmental chemicals (e.g.,
  synthetic heroin use). Its ultimate cause(s) is (are) unknown. Characterized
  by both motor and non-motor symptoms, PD patients classically display rest
  tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and stooping posture. PD can also be
  associated with neurobehavioral disorders (depression, anxiety), cognitive
  impairment (dementia), and autonomic dysfunction (e.g., orthostasis and
  hyperhidrosis). Recent decades have witnessed a proliferation of medical
  pharmacologic therapies and innovative surgical interventions like deep brain
  stimulation (DBS). However, definitive disease-modifying therapy is still
  lacking. Experimental therapies are being developed and tested with limited
  results. Knowledge of strategies to promote optimal quality of life for PD
  patients is of paramount importance for caregivers, health providers and
  patients themselves.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Asymmetry of dopaminergic neurodegeneration and subsequent lateralisation
  of motor symptoms are distinctive features of Parkinson’s disease compared
  to other forms of neurodegenerative or symptomatic parkinsonism. Even 200
  years after the first description of the disease, the underlying causes for
  this striking clinicopathological feature are not yet fully understood. There
  is increasing evidence that lateralisation of disease is due to a complex
  interplay of hereditary and environmental factors that are reflected not only
  in the concept of dominant hemispheres and handedness but also in specific
  susceptibilities of neuronal subpopulations within the substantia nigra. As a
  consequence, not only the obvious lateralisation of motor symptoms occurs but
  also patterns of associated non-motor signs are defined, which include
  cognitive functions, sleep behaviour or olfaction. Better understanding of
  the mechanisms contributing to lateralisation of neurodegeneration and the
  resulting patterns of clinical phenotypes based on bilateral post-mortem
  brain analyses and clinical studies focusing on right/left hemispheric
  symptom origin will help to develop more targeted therapeutic approaches,
  taking into account subtypes of PD as a heterogeneous disorder.%
